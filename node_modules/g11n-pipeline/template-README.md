Globalization Pipeline Client for JavaScript
============================================

This is the JavaScript SDK for the
[Globalization Pipeline](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/gp-common#globalization-pipeline)
Bluemix service. 
The Globalization Pipeline service makes it easy for you to provide your global customers
with Bluemix applications translated into the languages in which they work. 
This SDK currently supports [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

## Sample

For a working Bluemix application sample,
see [gp-nodejs-sample](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/gp-nodejs-sample).

## Quickstart

* You should familiarize yourself with the service itself. A
good place to begin is by reading the
[Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/gp-common#quick-start-guide)
and the official
[Getting Started with IBM Globalization ](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/GlobalizationPipeline/index.html) documentation.
The documentation explains how to find the service on Bluemix, create a new service instance, create a new bundle, and access the translated messages.

* Next, add `g11n-pipeline` to your project, as well as `cfenv` and `optional`.

    npm install --save g11n-pipeline cfenv optional

* Load the client object as follows (using [cfenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfenv) ).

```javascript
var optional = require('optional');
var appEnv = require('cfenv').getAppEnv();
var gpClient = require('g11n-pipeline').getClient(
  optional('./local-credentials.json')   // if it exists, use local-credentials.json
    || {appEnv: appEnv}                  // otherwise, the appEnv
);
```

* For local testing, create a `local-credentials.json` file with the credentials
as given in the bound service:

      {
        "credentials": {
          "url": "https://…",
          "userId": "…",
          "password": "……",
          "instanceId": "………"
        }
      }

## Using

To fetch the strings for a bundle named "hello", first create a bundle accessor:

```javascript
    var mybundle = gpClient.bundle('hello');
```

Then, call the `getStrings` function with a callback:

```javascript
    mybundle.getStrings({ languageId: 'es'}, function (err, result) {
        if (err) {
            // handle err..
            console.error(err);
        } else {
            var myStrings = result.resourceStrings;
            console.dir(myStrings);
        }
    });
```

This code snippet will output the translated strings such as the following:

```javascript
    {
        hello:   '¡Hola!',
        goodbye: '¡Adiós!',
        …
    }
```

### Async

Note that all calls that take a callback are asynchronous.
For example, the following code:

```javascript
var bundle = client.bundle('someBundle');
bundle.create({…}, function(…){…});
bundle.uploadStrings({…}, function(…){…});
```

…will fail, because the bundle `someBundle` hasn’t been `create`d by the time the
`uploadStrings` call is made. Instead, make the `uploadStrings` call within a callback:

```javascript
var bundle = client.bundle('someBundle');
bundle.create({…}, function(…){
    …
    bundle.uploadStrings({…}, function(…){…});
});
```

## Testing

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

API convention
==

APIs take a callback and use this general pattern:

```javascript
    gpClient.function( { /*opts*/ } ,  function callback(err, ...))
```

* opts: an object containing input parameters, if needed.
* `err`: if truthy, indicates an error has occured.
* `...`: other parameters (optional)

Sometimes the `opts` object is optional. If this is the case, the
API doc will indicate it with this notation:  `[opts]`
For example,  `bundle.getInfo(cb)` and `bundle.getInfo({}, cb)`  are equivalent.

These APIs may be promisified easily using a library such as `Q`'s
[nfcall](http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/#adapting-node):

```javascript
    return Q.ninvoke(bundle, "delete", {});
    return Q.ninvoke(gpClient, "getBundleList", {});
```

Also, note that there are aliases from the swagger doc function names
to the convenience name. For example, `bundle.uploadResourceStrings` can be 
used in place of `bundle.uploadStrings`.

All language identifiers are [IETF BCP47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) codes.
