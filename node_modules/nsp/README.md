## About Node Security

Node Security helps you keep your node applications secure. With Node Security you can:

* Make use of the CLI tool to help identify [known vulnerabilities](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/) in your own projects.
* Get access to Node Security news and information from the ^lift team.

## Installing the CLI (nsp)

* To install the Node Security command line tool: `npm install -g nsp`
* Then run `nsp --help` to find out more.

## Output Format

You can adjust how the client outputs findings by specifying one of the following format options:

- default
- summary
- json
- codeclimate
- none

Example: `nsp check --output summary`

Additionally, you can use [third-party formatters](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=nsp+formatter). The packages of custom formatters must adhere to the naming scheme `nsp-formatter-<name>` and can then be referenced by that name:
```bash
$ npm install -g nsp nsp-formatter-checkstyle
$ nsp check --output checkstyle
```
Please note that in case of naming conflicts built-in formatters (as listed above) take precedence. For instance, `nsp-formatter-json` would never be used since nsp ships with a `json` formatter.

## Exceptions

The Node Security CLI supports adding exceptions. These are advisories that you have evaluated and personally deemed unimportant for your project.

In order to leverage this capability, create a `.nsprc` file in the root of your project with content like the following:

```js
{
  "exceptions": ["https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/12"]
}
```

The URLs used in the array should match the advisory link that the CLI reports. With this in place, you will no longer receive warnings about any advisories in the exceptions array.

Be careful using this feature. If you add code later that is impacted by an excluded advisory, Node Security has no way of knowing. Keep a careful eye on your exceptions.

`.nsprc` is read using [rc](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc), so it supports comments using [json-strip-comments](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-json-comments).

## Proxy Support

The Node Security CLI has proxy support by using [proxy-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-agent).

The currently implemented protocol mappings are listed in the table below:


| Protocol   | Example
|:----------:|:--------:
| `http`     | `http://proxy-server-over-tcp.com:3128`
| `https`    | `https://proxy-server-over-tls.com:3129`
| `socks(v5)`| `socks://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional)
| `socks5`   | `socks5://username:password@some-socks-proxy.com:9050` (username & password are optional)
| `socks4`   | `socks4://some-socks-proxy.com:9050`
| `pac`      | `pac+http://www.example.com/proxy.pac`



To configure the proxy set the proxy key in your `.nsprc` file. This can be put in the root of your project or in your home directory.

```js
{
    "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
}
```

## Offline Mode
nsp has an offline mode which was previously undocumented. We recommend not relying on offline support as it may become unsupported in the future as new features are added.

First you need to obtain the offline advisories database. Do this by running the `npm run setup-offline` script provided by nsp

Second you need to tell nsp where to find that file. You can do that 3 ways.
1. Put it in the actual nsp module folder and no other configuration is required
1. Specify it in the .nsprc configuration file `advisoriesPath: "/path/to/advisories.json"`
1. Specify it from the command line when you call nsp `nsp check --offline --advisoriesPath=/path/to/advisories.json`

When you call nsp check you will want to use the --offline flag

A couple of notes
- Offline mode requires that your project include a npm-shrinkwrap.json file.
- Because of npm3 flattening reported paths may be incorrect.

## Code Climate Node Security Engine

`codeclimate-nodesecurity` is a Code Climate engine that wraps the Node Security CLI. You can run it on your command line using the Code Climate CLI, or Code Climate's <a href="http://codeclimate.com">hosted analysis platform</a>.

Note that this engine *only* works if your code has a `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file committed.

### Testing

First, build this repo with docker

```
git clone git@github.com:nodesecurity/nsp
cd nsp
docker build -t codeclimate/codeclimate-nodesecurity .
```

Install the codeclimate CLI

```
brew tap codeclimate/formulae
brew install codeclimate
```

Go into your project's directory and enable codeclimate

```
codeclimate init
```

Then edit `.codeclimate.yml` to add the engine like so

```yaml
---
engines:
  nodesecurity:
    enabled: true
exclude_paths: []
```

And finally run it

```
codeclimate analyze --dev
```

## Suggesting Changes to Advisories
Should you come across data in an advisory that you feel is wrong or is a false positive please let us know at report@nodesecurity.io. We endeavor to make this process better in the future, however this is the best place to resolve these issues at the present.
